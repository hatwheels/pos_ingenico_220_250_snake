# Snake-Clone running on Ingenico 220/250 POS
* Uses **Telium SDK** (developed by SAGEM Monotel) and IngeDEV IDE (an Ingenico customized **Eclipse IDE**)
* [Snake-Clone gameplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1Z9uBWw0vA)

**NOTE**: **Telium SDK** and **IngeDEV** IDE are proprietary, license-based and documentation about them is scarcily available. Officially, only SAGEM Monotel will provide training and all the information for setting up, developing, building and debugging. Therefore, I strongly advise anyone who wants to tinker with Ingenico POS, to ask any merchant selling Ingenico POS the following questions:

1. Are they an official seller of Ingenico POS?
2. Do they provide all information for setting up, developing, building and debugging a Ingenico POS project?
3. If the answer in 2. is negative, then do they provide a license that would provide that information?

**Disclaimer**: **I'm not affilated with SAGEM Monotel or its products Telium SDK and IngeDEV IDE nor do I have or provide any documentation. These are licensed products by SAGEM Monotel.**
